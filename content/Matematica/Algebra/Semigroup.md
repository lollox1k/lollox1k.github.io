**Def** (Semigroup) A set $S$ and a binary function $\gamma : S\times S \to S$ 
are called a _semigroup_ if
1. $\forall s_1,s_2,s_3 \in S$ $\gamma(s_1, \gamma(s_2,s_3)) = \gamma(\gamma(s_1,s_2), s_3)$ 

A semigroup is an associative magma.

Notation: $\mathcal{S} = (S,\cdot)$ where we use the cleaner intrafix notation. It's also common to call the semigroup with the same symbol as its support (universe) set. 



There is a natural way to define a new semigroup starting from one, with support the power set of the orginial one.

We start with the semigroup $(S,\cdot)$. We claim that $(2^S, \circ)$ is a semigroup, when the operation between subsets is defines as
$$
X \circ Y := \{xy \,:\, x \in X,\, y \in Y\}
$$
Clealry it's closed, since we get another subset of $S$. It's also associative, since: every element in $X \circ (Y \circ Z)$  can be written as $x(yz) = (xy)z$, this are precisley the elemetns in $(X\circ Y) \circ Z$.


**Def** (sub-semigroup) Starting from a semigroup $\mathcal{S} = (S,\cdot)$ given a subset $H\subseteq S$ we say that $\mathcal{H}=(H,\cdot|_{H\times H})$ is a semigroup of $\mathcal{S}$ and write $\mathcal{H} \leq \mathcal{S}$ if it is closed w.r.t. $\cdot$.

**Oss** Associativity is eredited from $S$.

An interesting question is, given any subset $X \subseteq S$, find the smallest semigroup that contains $X$. This can be done as usuale for the [[Sigma algebra]] generated by a set.

Call $\{\mathcal{T}_\gamma\}_{\gamma \in \Gamma}$ the family of evert semigroup of $S$ that contain $X$ in their support. Then
$$
\langle X \rangle := \bigcap_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \mathcal{T}_{\gamma}
$$
is the smallest sub-semigropu of $S$ that contains $X$ in its support.
**Proof** EZ. $\square$

### Semigroup homomorphism
As usual, the homomorphism is an operation beetween the support of algebraic structers that preserves their structure, i.e. it behaves well w.r.t. thei operation.

Let $\mathcal{S} = (S, \cdot)$ and $\mathcal{T} = (T, *)$ be two semigroups. 
A total mapping $\phi : S \to T$ is called a _semigroup morphism_ if
$\forall s_1,s_2 \in S$
$$
\phi(s_1 \cdot s_2) = \phi(s_1)*\phi(s_2)
$$
(the morphism property)

Birkhoff classification of morphism:
1. _Epi-morphism_: $\phi$ is surjective
2. _Mono-morphism_: $\phi$ is injective
3. _Iso-morphism_: $\phi$ is bijective
4. _Endo-morphism_: $T \subseteq S$
5. _Auto-morphism_: $T = S$ and $\phi$ bijective
### Congruence of semigroups
Let $R \subseteq S \times S$ be an equivalence realtion in $S$. We use the notation $xRy$ if $xy \in R$.

For all $s_1,s_2,t \in S$, $R$ is called a

right-conrguence of $S$ if:   $s_1Rs_2 = (s_1t)R(s_2t)$
left-conrguence of $S$ if:   $s_1Rs_2 = (ts_1)R(ts_2)$

congruence of $S$ if is both a left and a right-congruence.


We can define a new semigroup with the equivalance classes of $S$ under $R$.

Let $S/R := \{[s]_R \,:\, s \in S\}$  the quotient set of $S$ under $R$.
this will be our new support. We define the operation on the equivalence classes as:
$\forall  [s], [t] \in S/R$ 
$$
[s]\circ [t] := [s\cdot t]
$$

**Claim** $(S/R, \circ)$ is a semigroup. 
**Proof** Clealry it's close. Let's prove associativity:
$$
([s]\circ[t]) \circ [r] = [s\cdot t]\circ [r] = [(s\cdot t) \cdot r]
$$
$$
= [s\cdot (t \cdot r)] = [s] \circ [t\cdot r] = [s]\circ([t]\circ [r])
$$

If $R$ is a congruence for the semigroup $S$, then the function that maps any element into its equivalence class, called the _canonic morphism_
$$
\pi_R: S \to S/R, \quad s \mapsto [s]
$$
is an epi-homorphism from ($S, \cdot)$ to $(S/R, \circ)$, since
$$
\pi_R(s_1\cdot s_2) = [s_1\cdot s_2] = [s_1]\circ [s_2] = \pi_R[s_1] \circ \pi_R[s_2] \quad \square
$$

Given any morphism $\phi : S \to T$, we can create a congruence on $S$, the _canonic congruence_ of $\phi$ $R_\phi$. $\forall s_1,s_2 \in S$
$$
s_1R_\phi s_2 \iff \phi(s_1) = \phi(s_2)
$$
**Oss** If $\phi$ is a mono-morphism (injective) then $R_\phi$ is trivial.

**Theorem** (_fondamental theorem of semigroup morphism_) 
Let $\phi : S \to S'$ be an epi-morphism (surjective), and let $R = R_\phi$ be its canonic conrgruence relation and $\pi = \pi_R$ its canonic epi-morphism.
Then there exists an _isomorphism_ (bijective) 
$$
\mathcal{\xi} : S/R \to S'
$$
such that
$$
\phi(s) = \xi(\pi(s)) \qquad \forall s \in S
$$
Which can be written also as $\phi = \xi \circ \pi$.

This theorem can be written as the commutative diagram:
