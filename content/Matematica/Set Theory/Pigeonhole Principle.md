**Theorem** (Pigeonhole principle) Let $n$ be a positive integer. If more than $n$ objects are distribuited among $n$ containers, then some container must contain more than one object.
**Proof**  Suppose by contradiciont that in all $n$ containers there is at most one object, then in total we would have at most $n$ objects. $\square$

We can say more if $m$ is a lot bigger than $n$:

**Theorem** (Generalized pigeonhole principle) If we distribuite more than $mn$ object in $n$ containers, then there exists at least one which contains $m$ objects.
**Proof** As before, suppose by contraddiction that each container at most has $mn$ objects. Then in total we have less or equal $mn$ objects. $\square$
